        In a little district west of Washington Square the streets have run
        crazy and broken themselves into small strips called “places.” These
        “places” make strange angles and curves. One street crosses itself a
        time or two. An artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this
        street. It was that the irregularity of the street relieved the monotony
        of line and shadow that a straight street always produces.
